            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Reclaim Media was born from a simple question: What happens when you give AI a soul?
            </p>
            <p>
                We're not interested in AI that replaces human creativity. We're interested in AI that amplifies it. 
                Every artist on our roster started as an experiment, a "what if" that became something more. 
                What if an AI could write country songs that actually make you feel something? 
                What if technology could capture the loneliness of a small-town Saturday night?
            </p>
            <p>
                The answer surprised us. It turns out, the tools don't matter as much as the intention behind them. 
                Our artists aren't trying to pass as human. They're something new: digital souls with real stories to tell.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Authenticity over perfection.</strong> Our music has imperfections because perfection isn't interesting. 
                We're not trying to create flawless AI content. We're trying to create content that connects.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Transparency matters.</strong> We're upfront about what we do. Dakota Rose is an AI artist, and we say so. 
                There's no deception, no hidden agendas. Just experimental art made with new tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Technology serves story.</strong> AI is our instrument, not our identity. The songs, the characters, 
                the experiences we create: those are what matter. The technology is just how we get there.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>What We Create</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Music:</strong> Full albums with original compositions, vocals, and production. Each artist has 
                a distinct sound and story.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Visual Content:</strong> Music videos, social media content, promotional materials. Our artists 
                exist across platforms, building real audiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Digital Experiences:</strong> Interactive web experiences, AR/VR experiments, and whatever 
                else seems interesting. We're always exploring.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Brand Partnerships:</strong> Custom AI content for companies looking to innovate. If you have 
                an idea that seems impossible, let's talk.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>
                We're just getting started. Dakota Rose is our first artist, but she won't be our last. 
                We're developing new characters across genres, each with their own voice, their own story, their own reason to exist.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal isn't to build an army of AI musicians. It's to explore what's possible when you treat 
                AI as a creative partner rather than a replacement. To find the humanity in the algorithm.
            </p>
            <p>
                If that sounds interesting to you, <a href="/contact/" style="color: var(--accent);">get in touch</a>. 
                We're always looking for collaborators, partners, and people who think differently.
