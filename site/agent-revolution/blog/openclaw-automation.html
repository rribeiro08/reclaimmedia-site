    <div class="article-content">

        <p>The moment your agent starts doing things without being asked is the moment it stops being a chatbot and becomes an agent. Automation is what makes the <a href="ai-agents-vs-assistants.html">agent vs assistant distinction</a> real — a proactive AI that monitors, alerts, reports, and acts on schedule transforms your relationship with technology.</p>

        <p>OpenClaw's automation happens through two systems: the heartbeat (built-in scheduled checks) and integration with system cron for more complex scheduling. Both are simple to set up and dramatically expand what your agent can do.</p>

        <h2>The Heartbeat System</h2>

        <p>The heartbeat is OpenClaw's native automation engine. At regular intervals, the agent "wakes up" and checks <code>HEARTBEAT.md</code> in your workspace for tasks to perform. Think of it as a configurable alarm clock for your agent.</p>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The gateway fires a heartbeat at configured intervals (typically every 15-60 minutes)</li>
            <li>The agent reads HEARTBEAT.md</li>
            <li>It evaluates which tasks are due based on time and conditions</li>
            <li>It executes due tasks and logs results to daily <a href="openclaw-memory-system.html">memory</a></li>
            <li>If a task produces output for you, it sends it to the configured channel</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Your First HEARTBEAT.md</h3>

        <div class="code-block">
<span class="comment"># HEARTBEAT.md</span>

## Core Principle
Catch leverage early, ignore noise. Silence = nothing worth acting on.

## Morning Briefing
- **When:** 5:30am weekdays
- **Channel:** Telegram
- **Tasks:**
  - Check today's calendar events
  - Review yesterday's memory for pending items
  - Summarize overnight work completed
  - Flag urgent emails or messages
  - Weather forecast for the day

## Evening Scan
- **When:** 8:00pm daily
- **Channel:** Telegram
- **Tasks:**
  - Summarize what was accomplished today
  - List items that need attention tomorrow
  - Check for any scheduled overnight work to approve

## Health Check
- **When:** Every 4 hours
- **Action:** Check gateway status, channel connections, disk space
- **Alert only if:** Something is wrong
        </div>

        <p>Notice the principle at the top: "Silence = nothing worth acting on." This is crucial. A heartbeat that sends you a message every 15 minutes saying "Everything is fine!" defeats the purpose. The agent should only contact you when there's something worth your attention.</p>

        <h2>Common Automation Recipes</h2>

        <h3>1. Morning Briefing (The Gateway Drug)</h3>

        <p>This is where most people start, and it's immediately valuable:</p>

        <div class="code-block">
## Morning Briefing
- **When:** 6:00am weekdays
- **Channel:** Telegram (as voice message)
- **Include:**
  - Calendar: Today's meetings with times and participants
  - Tasks: Open action items from yesterday
  - Emails: Flagged or urgent messages
  - Weather: Temperature and conditions
  - Custom: [Add anything relevant to your work]
        </div>

        <p>Using the TTS <a href="openclaw-skills.html">skill</a>, this can be delivered as an audio message you listen to while getting ready — arguably the most pleasant way to start a workday.</p>

        <h3>2. Website Monitoring</h3>

        <div class="code-block">
## Website Monitor
- **When:** Every 2 hours
- **Check:** https://status.yourservice.com
- **Alert if:** Status is not "All Systems Operational"
- **Also check:** Response time > 3 seconds
- **Channel:** Telegram + Slack
        </div>

        <h3>3. Competitive Intelligence</h3>

        <div class="code-block">
## Competitor Watch
- **When:** 9:00am weekdays
- **Do:**
  - Search web for "[Competitor Name] news" (past 24 hours)
  - Check competitor pricing page for changes
  - Scan competitor social media for announcements
- **Report:** Only if new information found
- **Save:** Findings to memory/competitive-intel.md
        </div>

        <h3>4. Content Pipeline</h3>

        <div class="code-block">
## Content Check
- **When:** 10:00am Monday
- **Do:**
  - Review content calendar for the week
  - Check which posts are drafted but not published
  - Identify gaps in the publishing schedule
  - Generate content brief for missing slots
- **Report:** Telegram with action items
        </div>

        <h3>5. System Maintenance</h3>

        <div class="code-block">
## System Health
- **When:** Every 6 hours
- **Check:**
  - Disk space (alert if > 85% used)
  - Memory usage
  - pm2 process status
  - SSL certificate expiry (alert if < 14 days)
  - Backup status
- **Alert only if:** Issues detected
        </div>

        </div>

        <h2>System Cron Integration</h2>

        <p>For more granular scheduling or tasks that need to run regardless of gateway state, you can use system cron:</p>

        <div class="code-block">
<span class="comment"># Edit crontab</span>
crontab -e

<span class="comment"># Morning briefing at 5:30am weekdays</span>
30 5 * * 1-5 openclaw run "Deliver morning briefing to Telegram"

<span class="comment"># Hourly health check</span>
0 * * * * openclaw run "Check system health, alert if issues"

<span class="comment"># Daily backup at midnight</span>
0 0 * * * openclaw run "Backup workspace to git, commit daily changes"

<span class="comment"># Weekly report every Friday at 4pm</span>
0 16 * * 5 openclaw run "Generate weekly summary and send to Telegram"
        </div>

        <p>The <code>openclaw run</code> command sends a message to your agent as if you typed it. The agent processes it with full access to its personality, memory, skills, and tools.</p>

        <h2>The Overnight Work Pattern</h2>

        <p>One powerful automation pattern: queue work in the evening, let the agent execute overnight, review results in the morning.</p>

        <div class="code-block">
<span class="comment"># In AGENTS.md or a dedicated overnight-work.md</span>

## Overnight Work Flow
1. **8pm:** Evening scan delivers findings and proposals
2. **Rudi approves:** Mark items as APPROVED
3. **Overnight:** Agent moves items to IN PROGRESS, executes
4. **5:30am:** Morning briefing reports COMPLETED items

## Current Queue
### APPROVED
- Generate 7 social media posts for next week
- Research top 5 VPS providers and create comparison

### IN PROGRESS
[Agent moves items here during execution]

### COMPLETED
[Agent moves items here when done, includes results]
        </div>

        <p>This pattern is incredibly efficient. You approve a batch of work before bed. You wake up to completed deliverables. Your agent literally works while you sleep.</p>

        <h2>Automation Safety</h2>

        <p>Automated tasks respect your trust tier configuration in <a href="openclaw-security.html">AGENTS.md</a>:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tier 1 tasks</strong> (read, search, analyze, draft) run freely during automation</li>
            <li><strong>Tier 2 tasks</strong> (deploy, schedule) execute but notify you</li>
            <li><strong>Tier 3 tasks</strong> (external communications, spending) are queued for your approval, even during automated runs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This means your 3am health check can read logs and analyze errors (Tier 1), restart a crashed service (Tier 2 with notification), but won't send an email to your client about the outage (Tier 3 — waits for your approval).</p>

        <h2>Debugging Automation</h2>

        <h3>Check Heartbeat Logs</h3>
        <div class="code-block">
<span class="comment"># View recent heartbeat activity</span>
openclaw gateway logs --filter heartbeat

<span class="comment"># Check if heartbeats are firing</span>
openclaw gateway status
        </div>

        <h3>Common Issues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heartbeats not firing:</strong> Check gateway is running, heartbeat interval is configured</li>
            <li><strong>Tasks not executing:</strong> Check HEARTBEAT.md formatting, ensure conditions are met</li>
            <li><strong>No output:</strong> The agent may have determined there's nothing to report (which is correct behavior)</li>
            <li><strong>Too many notifications:</strong> Add "alert only if" conditions to reduce noise</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advanced: Chaining Automations</h2>

        <p>Individual automations are useful. Chains are powerful:</p>

        <div class="code-block">
## Content Automation Chain
1. **Monday 9am:** Research trending topics (web search)
2. **Monday 10am:** Generate content briefs from research
3. **Monday-Wednesday:** Draft articles from approved briefs
4. **Thursday 9am:** Compile all drafts for review
5. **Friday:** Schedule approved content for next week
        </div>

        <p>Each step depends on the previous one. The agent manages the state, tracks progress in daily memory, and only proceeds when preconditions are met.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
