        <p>Memory is what separates an AI agent from a chatbot. Without memory, every conversation starts from zero — the AI doesn't know your name, your projects, your preferences, or what happened yesterday. With memory, your agent becomes a genuine partner that grows more useful every day.</p>

        <p>OpenClaw's memory system is one of its most powerful features, and it's elegantly simple. No databases, no vector stores, no complex infrastructure. Just markdown files. Let me explain how it works and how to get the most out of it.</p>

        <h2>The Two-Tier Architecture</h2>

        <p>OpenClaw's memory has two layers, each serving a different purpose:</p>

        <h3>Tier 1: Daily Memory (Raw)</h3>

        <p>Daily memory files live at <code>memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md</code> in your workspace. They contain raw logs of what happened each day — conversations, decisions, tasks completed, errors encountered, and anything the agent deems worth recording.</p>

        <div class="code-block">
<span class="comment"># memory/2026-02-14.md</span>

## Morning
- Delivered morning briefing at 5:30am
- 3 emails flagged for follow-up
- Rudi asked about VPS pricing for secondary deployment

## Afternoon
- Completed blog article draft on OpenClaw memory system
- Deployed site updates to production
- Calendar conflict detected: 2pm meeting overlaps with dentist

## Decisions
- Chose Hetzner over DigitalOcean for cost (saved €2/mo)
- Rudi approved batch of 7 social media posts
        </div>

        <p>Daily memory is automatic. Your agent creates and updates these files throughout the day without you doing anything. They're raw, unfiltered records — everything that happened, logged chronologically.</p>

        <p><strong>What the agent loads:</strong> At the start of each session, the agent reads today's and yesterday's daily memory files. This gives it recent context without overloading the context window.</p>

        <h3>Tier 2: Long-Term Memory (Curated)</h3>

        <p>Long-term memory lives in <code>MEMORY.md</code> at the root of your workspace. Unlike daily memory, this file is curated — it contains only information that's persistently important.</p>

        <div class="code-block">
<span class="comment"># MEMORY.md</span>

        <p><strong>MEMORY.md is always loaded.</strong> Every session, every conversation. This is the agent's permanent knowledge base about you and your world.</p>

        <p>The key principle: <strong>write to MEMORY.md only if future-you would be annoyed not having this context.</strong> Don't put today's to-do list here. Do put your wife's birthday, your pricing decisions, and recurring preferences.</p>

        <h2>How Memory Flows</h2>

        <p>Here's the lifecycle of information in OpenClaw's memory:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Something happens</strong> — A conversation, a task, a decision</li>
            <li><strong>Daily memory captures it</strong> — Raw, automatic, in today's file</li>
            <li><strong>Agent evaluates significance</strong> — Is this a one-time thing or a lasting pattern?</li>
            <li><strong>Promotion to MEMORY.md</strong> — If it's lasting, the agent (or you) moves it to long-term memory</li>
            <li><strong>Daily memory ages out</strong> — After 48 hours, it's no longer auto-loaded (but the file stays on disk)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This creates a natural filtering process. Ephemeral information stays in daily logs. Important patterns and decisions graduate to long-term memory. Nothing is lost, but only what matters gets loaded every session.</p>

        <h2>Context Recovery</h2>

        <p>AI models have context windows — a maximum amount of text they can "see" at once. When a conversation gets long or context gets truncated, the agent loses track of what was being discussed.</p>

        <p>OpenClaw handles this through <strong>context recovery</strong>. When the agent detects its context has been truncated, it can:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Pull recent conversation history from the session log</li>
            <li>Read the latest daily memory files</li>
            <li>Load MEMORY.md for persistent context</li>
            <li>Resume the conversation seamlessly</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This means your agent never has to ask "What were we talking about?" It can reconstruct context from its memory files.</p>

        <h2>Configuring Memory Behavior</h2>

        <p>You control how your agent handles memory through <a href="soul-md-guide.html">SOUL.md</a> and <code>AGENTS.md</code>. Key settings:</p>

        <h3>What to Log in Daily Memory</h3>

        <p>In your AGENTS.md, specify what gets logged:</p>

        <div class="code-block">
## Memory
- Create `memory/` if needed
- Raw logs of what happened
- No filtering, no polishing
- Include: decisions, tasks completed, notable conversations
- Include: errors encountered and how they were resolved
        </div>

        <h3>What to Promote to MEMORY.md</h3>

        <div class="code-block">
Write to MEMORY.md only if future-you would be annoyed not having this context.

Include:
- Decisions (with date and rationale)
- Lasting insights and patterns
- Personal preferences that affect agent behavior
- Key facts about people, projects, accounts

Avoid:
- Daily chatter
- Temporary facts
- Anything easily re-derived
        </div>

        <h3>Memory Security</h3>

        <p>MEMORY.md often contains personal information. OpenClaw has a critical security rule: <strong>MEMORY.md should only be loaded in the main (private) session.</strong> In group chats, Discord servers, or shared channels, the agent should not load private memory to prevent information leakage.</p>

        <div class="code-block">
<span class="comment"># In AGENTS.md</span>
## Memory Security
- **ONLY load MEMORY.md in main session**
- **DO NOT load in shared contexts** (Discord, group chats, other humans)
- Contains personal context - security matters
        </div>

        <h2>Practical Memory Tips</h2>

        <h3>1. Seed Your Memory</h3>
        <p>Don't wait for your agent to learn everything organically. Before your first conversation, create MEMORY.md with essential context — your name, timezone, work schedule, family names, current projects, and key preferences. The ROI on 5 minutes of seeding is enormous.</p>

        <h3>2. Review Daily Memory Weekly</h3>
        <p>Scan your daily memory files once a week. You'll find useful context that should be promoted to MEMORY.md, or entries that reveal patterns you want to reinforce or change.</p>

        <h3>3. Use Memory for Decision Logging</h3>
        <p>One of the most valuable uses of MEMORY.md is tracking decisions with context. When you make a significant choice, have your agent log it with the date and rationale. This prevents re-litigating old decisions and helps the agent make consistent future recommendations.</p>

        <h3>4. Version Control Your Memory</h3>
        <p>Your workspace is just a directory of text files. Put it under Git version control:</p>

        <div class="code-block">
<span class="comment"># Initialize version control</span>
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial workspace setup"

<span class="comment"># Automate daily commits</span>
git add -A && git commit -m "Daily memory update $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
        </div>

        <h3>5. Don't Over-Curate</h3>
        <p>MEMORY.md should be useful, not perfect. A slightly messy memory file that contains the right information beats a beautifully formatted one that's missing key context. Optimize for recall value, not aesthetics.</p>

        <h2>Memory vs RAG: Why Files Win</h2>

        <p>Some AI platforms use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) — storing memories as vector embeddings in a database and retrieving relevant chunks per query. For personal agents, plain files have significant advantages:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Transparency</strong> — You can read and edit your agent's memory in any text editor</li>
            <li><strong>Portability</strong> — Memory files work across any system, any AI model, any backup solution</li>
            <li><strong>Reliability</strong> — No embedding model drift, no semantic search failures, no database corruption</li>
            <li><strong>Simplicity</strong> — No additional infrastructure to maintain</li>
            <li><strong>Human override</strong> — Correct memories directly by editing the file</li>
        </ul>

        <p>RAG has its place in enterprise systems with millions of documents. For a personal agent, markdown files are the right abstraction.</p>

        <h2>What Memory Enables</h2>

        <p>Memory is what makes these scenarios possible:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Morning briefings</strong> — Your agent summarizes yesterday's logs, today's calendar, and pending tasks</li>
            <li><strong>Project continuity</strong> — "Continue working on the blog article" works because the agent remembers which article</li>
            <li><strong>Personal touch</strong> — The agent knows your wife's name, your kids' ages, and that you hate mornings</li>
            <li><strong>Learning preferences</strong> — Over time, the agent calibrates its style based on accumulated feedback</li>
            <li><strong>Accountability</strong> — "What did we decide about pricing?" is instantly answerable</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Without memory, every one of these requires you to re-explain context. With memory, your agent just knows.</p>
