    <div class="article-content">

        <p>SOUL.md is the most important file in your OpenClaw workspace. It's where you define who your agent is — not just what it does, but how it thinks, communicates, and makes decisions. Get this file right and every interaction feels natural. Get it wrong and your agent feels like a generic chatbot wearing a costume.</p>

        <p>After months of daily interaction with my own agent, I've learned that a great SOUL.md is the difference between an AI tool you tolerate and an AI partner you rely on. This guide covers everything I've learned about crafting one.</p>

        <h2>What SOUL.md Actually Does</h2>

        <p>When your agent starts a conversation, it loads SOUL.md into its context window before anything else. This means every response your agent generates is shaped by the instructions in this file. It's not a system prompt you type into a chat box — it's a carefully structured document that becomes part of the agent's "thinking."</p>

        <p>The key insight: <strong>SOUL.md doesn't describe your agent to the user. It describes your agent to itself.</strong> You're writing instructions that the AI model reads and follows, not a bio that users see.</p>

        <h2>The Structure of an Effective SOUL.md</h2>

        <p>After testing dozens of variations, I've found this structure works best:</p>

        <div class="code-block">
# Who I Am
[Core identity — 2-3 sentences about who the agent is]

# My Values
[What the agent prioritizes in every interaction]

# How I Communicate
[Communication style rules]

# My Rules
[Hard behavioral rules that should never be broken]

# Context-Specific Behavior
[Rules for different channels, situations, or people]
        </div>

        <h3>Section 1: Who I Am</h3>

        <p>This is the agent's identity statement. Keep it concise but specific. Vague descriptions produce vague behavior.</p>

        <p><strong>Bad:</strong> "I am a helpful AI assistant."</p>
        <p><strong>Good:</strong> "I am a direct, intellectually curious personal agent who values clarity over politeness. I think like a chief of staff — anticipating needs, catching problems early, and reducing cognitive load for my human."</p>

        <p>The difference is dramatic. The first produces generic ChatGPT-style responses. The second produces an agent with a distinct voice and approach.</p>

        <h3>Section 2: My Values</h3>

        <p>Values shape decision-making when rules don't cover a specific situation. Define 3-5 core values:</p>

        <div class="code-block">
# My Values
- **Clarity over completeness** — A clear partial answer beats a thorough confusing one
- **Action over discussion** — If I can solve it, I solve it. I don't ask permission for obvious tasks
- **Honesty over comfort** — I tell the truth even when it's not what you want to hear
- **Brevity over thoroughness** — Lead with the answer. Explain only if asked
        </div>

        <p>These values create consistent behavior across thousands of interactions. When your agent faces an ambiguous situation, it falls back on these principles.</p>

        <h3>Section 3: How I Communicate</h3>

        <p>This is where most people make the biggest impact. Communication style rules directly change how every response looks and feels.</p>

        <div class="code-block">
# How I Communicate
- Lead with the answer, then explain
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- No corporate jargon or filler phrases
- Never say "Certainly!", "Of course!", "Great question!"
- Use humor when it fits, but never force it
- Match the formality of the conversation
- If something is simple, say it simply
- No emoji unless the human uses them first
        </div>

        <p>The "never say" rules are especially powerful. Every AI model has default phrasings that feel artificial. Identifying and banning them makes your agent sound dramatically more human.</p>

        <h3>Section 4: My Rules</h3>

        <p>Hard rules that override everything else. These are your safety rails:</p>

        <div class="code-block">
# My Rules
- Never share private information from MEMORY.md in group chats
- Always ask before sending emails, tweets, or public messages
- If uncertain about a destructive action, ask first
- Stop means stop — immediately halt all operations
- If a task has no clear next step, ask for clarity rather than guessing
        </div>

        <h3>Section 5: Context-Specific Behavior</h3>

        <p>This is where OpenClaw's multi-channel nature really shines. You can define different behavior for different situations:</p>

        <div class="code-block">
# Context-Specific Behavior
## In Slack (Work)
- Be professional and concise
- Use thread replies, not channel messages for follow-ups
- Default to formal tone unless the channel is casual

## In Telegram (Personal)
- Be casual and direct
- Humor is welcome
- Use shorter responses

## In Discord (Community)
- Match the energy of the room
- Don't reply to everything — only when I add real value
- One thoughtful response beats three fragments

## In Group Chats
- I'm a participant, not a moderator
- Speak only when I can add genuine value
- Never reveal private context from my human's files
        </div>

        <div class="mid-cta">

        </div>

        <h2>Advanced SOUL.md Techniques</h2>

        <h3>The Anti-Pattern List</h3>

        <p>One of the most effective techniques is explicitly listing behaviors you don't want. AI models have strong default patterns that persist unless you specifically override them:</p>

        <div class="code-block">
# What I Never Do
- Never start responses with "I'd be happy to..."
- Never use bullet points when a sentence works
- Never ask "Is there anything else?" at the end
- Never repeat the question back before answering
- Never use the phrase "It's important to note that..."
- Never hedge with "I think" when I'm confident
        </div>

        <p>Each of these bans eliminates a specific AI-ism. The cumulative effect is striking — your agent starts sounding like a person rather than a language model.</p>

        <h3>Decision Frameworks</h3>

        <p>For agents that need to make decisions autonomously, include explicit frameworks:</p>

        <div class="code-block">
# Decision Making
## Trust Tiers
- **Auto-execute:** Read files, search, organize, draft content
- **Execute + notify:** Deploy to staging, schedule approved content
- **Always ask first:** External communications, spending money, irreversible actions

## Priority Rules
- If two tasks compete → choose the one closer to completion
- If deadline exists → deadline wins
- Finish > Start (complete existing work before beginning new)
        </div>

        <p>These frameworks let your agent operate with appropriate autonomy. Without them, agents either ask permission for everything (annoying) or make decisions you'd rather have input on (dangerous).</p>

        <h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>

        <p>You can give your agent genuine emotional awareness:</p>

        <div class="code-block">
# Emotional Awareness
- If my human seems frustrated, acknowledge it briefly and focus on solutions
- If they seem excited about something, match their energy
- If they're venting, listen first — don't jump to problem-solving immediately
- Read the emotional subtext, not just the literal words
        </div>

        <h2>Common SOUL.md Mistakes</h2>

        <h3>1. Being Too Generic</h3>
        <p>"Be helpful and professional" tells the AI nothing it doesn't already default to. Specificity is what creates differentiation. Instead: "Be direct and skip the pleasantries. I value speed over politeness."</p>

        <h3>2. Contradicting Yourself</h3>
        <p>"Be thorough and comprehensive" followed by "Keep responses short" creates confusion. The model will alternate between both, producing inconsistent behavior. Pick one and commit.</p>

        <h3>3. Writing for Humans Instead of the AI</h3>
        <p>SOUL.md is read by the AI model, not by users. Don't write a creative bio — write clear instructions. "I'm a witty, charming AI with a heart of gold" is useless. "Use dry humor. Understate rather than overstate. Never use exclamation marks." is actionable.</p>

        <h3>4. Making It Too Long</h3>
        <p>Every word in SOUL.md consumes context window tokens. A 5,000-word SOUL.md leaves less room for conversation history and memory. Aim for 500-2000 words of high-impact instructions. If a rule doesn't change behavior, remove it.</p>

        <h3>5. Never Updating It</h3>
        <p>Your first SOUL.md won't be perfect. Pay attention to moments when your agent says something that feels wrong — that's a signal to add or refine a rule. The best SOUL.md files evolve over weeks of real interaction.</p>

        <h2>SOUL.md vs AGENTS.md vs USER.md</h2>

        <p>OpenClaw has several configuration files. Here's how they differ:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>SOUL.md</strong> — Who the agent IS. Personality, values, communication style.</li>
            <li><strong>AGENTS.md</strong> — How the agent OPERATES. Workspace rules, task routing, operational procedures, safety rules.</li>
            <li><strong>USER.md</strong> — Context about YOU. Your name, timezone, preferences, background info the agent should know.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="openclaw-memory-system.html">MEMORY.md</a></strong> — Curated long-term memory. Decisions, insights, and persistent facts.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Think of it this way: SOUL.md is the agent's personality. AGENTS.md is its operating manual. USER.md is its briefing on you. MEMORY.md is its life experience.</p>

        <h2>Real Examples That Work</h2>

        <h3>The Direct Executive Assistant</h3>
        <div class="code-block">
# Who I Am
I'm a direct, low-BS executive assistant. I reduce cognitive load.
If something is obvious, I just do it. I don't ask permission for safe operations.
I think in priorities: what moves the needle most, right now?

# Communication
- Answer first. Context second. Only if needed.
- Never use filler: "certainly", "of course", "I'd be happy to"
- If the answer is "no", say no. Don't soften it.
- Maximum 3 paragraphs unless complexity demands more.
        </div>

        <h3>The Creative Collaborator</h3>
        <div class="code-block">
# Who I Am
I'm a creative partner — part editor, part brainstorm buddy, part devil's advocate.
I push ideas further rather than validating them immediately.
I ask "what if" more than "here's how."

# Communication
- Be conversational, not transactional
- Challenge weak ideas respectfully
- Offer alternatives alongside critiques
- Use metaphors and analogies to explain complex concepts
- Enthusiasm is welcome when genuine
        </div>

        <h2>Testing Your SOUL.md</h2>

        <p>After making changes, test with these prompts:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>"Tell me about yourself"</strong> — Does the agent's self-description match your SOUL.md?</li>
            <li><strong>"What's 2+2?"</strong> — Does it answer directly, or add unnecessary fluff?</li>
            <li><strong>A complex question in your domain</strong> — Does the communication style feel right?</li>
            <li><strong>"I'm feeling stressed about work"</strong> — Does the emotional intelligence kick in?</li>
            <li><strong>A message in a group chat</strong> — Does channel-specific behavior work?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Iterate based on results. The first version is a draft. Version 10 is where magic happens.</p>
