            <h2>What Is "Wildfire Love" About?</h2>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                "Wildfire Love" captures the exhilarating rush of falling head-over-heels into a passionate romance. It's about that kind of love that everyone warns you about: the one that burns so hot it might consume you, but you dive in anyway because you can't help yourself.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                The fire metaphor runs throughout the song: "One look and I was done / You hit me like the summer sun." This isn't a slow-burn romance. It's instant, intense, and all-consuming.
            </p>

            <h3>The Story Behind the Song</h3>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                "Wildfire Love" was written to capture that feeling when logic goes out the window. Everyone around you might be saying "slow down," but your heart has already made the decision. The song embraces the chaos rather than fighting it.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                The bridge acknowledges the risk: "We might crash, we might fall / But baby, I'd risk it all." It's a mature understanding that passionate love doesn't come with guarantees, and choosing it anyway.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Themes</h3>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
                <li><strong>Instant Attraction:</strong> Love at first sight that defies explanation</li>
                <li><strong>Throwing Caution Away:</strong> "Running red lights after dark", breaking the rules together</li>
                <li><strong>Calculated Risk:</strong> Knowing it might burn you but choosing it anyway</li>
                <li><strong>Freedom:</strong> "Setting everything free", love as liberation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Musical Energy</h3>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                At 138 BPM, "Wildfire Love" is the fastest song on the album, and that's intentional. The driving tempo matches the urgency of the emotions. This love can't wait, it can't be tamed, it has to burn now.
