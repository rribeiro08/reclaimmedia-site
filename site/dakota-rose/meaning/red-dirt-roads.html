            <h2>What Is "Red Dirt Roads" About?</h2>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                "Red Dirt Roads" is about the pull of home: the way the place you grew up shapes who you are, even when you leave. It's the story of someone who left their small town seeking something more, only to realize that everything they truly needed was right there all along.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                The red dirt roads become a symbol of identity: "These red dirt roads run through my veins." They're not just physical paths but emotional ones: the memories, the people, the values that were instilled there.
            </p>
