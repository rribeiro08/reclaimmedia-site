            <h2>What Is "Learn to Leave" About?</h2>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                "Learn to Leave" is the perfect album closer. After 9 tracks of heartbreak, confusion, and gradual acceptance, this song is about finally walking through the door. It's the hardest lesson of all: learning how to leave someone you still love.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                The song acknowledges that leaving isn't about stopping love. It's about wanting more. About deserving better. About the reframing that leaving isn't goodbye, but learning how to fly on your own for the first time.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Themes</h3>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-left: 1.5rem; color: rgba(255,255,255,0.8);">
                <li><strong>Difficulty of Leaving:</strong> Standing at the door for years</li>
                <li><strong>Fear of Unknown:</strong> The only life you know</li>
                <li><strong>Growth:</strong> Leaving as learning to fly</li>
                <li><strong>New Beginnings:</strong> This is where my next life begins</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Album Arc</h3>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                The shift from "I'm still learning" in the early verses to "I finally learned" in the final chorus represents the entire journey of "Static." We start in midnight thoughts and end with the clarity of dawn.
