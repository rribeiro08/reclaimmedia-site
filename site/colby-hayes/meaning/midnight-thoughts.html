            <h2>What Is "Midnight Thoughts" About?</h2>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                "Midnight Thoughts" captures that universally relatable experience of lying awake when you should be sleeping, unable to stop replaying conversations and memories. It's the album opener for a reason: it sets the emotional tone for everything that follows.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                The song paints a picture of someone trapped in the quiet hours, when distractions fade and you're left alone with your thoughts. The streetlight through the blinds, the phone face-down, the jacket behind the door. Every detail is a reminder of someone who's gone.
            </p>

            <h3>The Story Behind the Song</h3>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                Colby wrote this song about the specific loneliness of 2AM when you're not quite asleep and not quite awake. It's about that moment when you realize you're still holding onto things that don't belong to you anymore. The line "Maybe I just like the ghost of who I was when I loved you most" speaks to the complicated way we sometimes miss not just the person, but the version of ourselves we were with them.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Themes</h3>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-left: 1.5rem; color: rgba(255,255,255,0.8);">
                <li><strong>Insomnia & Vulnerability:</strong> The night strips away our defenses</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Objects:</strong> Physical reminders (the jacket, the phone) that keep us connected to the past</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Awareness:</strong> Knowing you're stuck but not yet ready to let go</li>
                <li><strong>Hope:</strong> The final line reminds us that tomorrow is just a few hours away</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Musical Approach</h3>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                The production is deliberately sparse and intimate, mirroring the 3AM bedroom setting. Soft guitar picking, gentle synth pads, and Colby's vulnerable vocal delivery create the feeling of a private confession you're not quite meant to hear.
