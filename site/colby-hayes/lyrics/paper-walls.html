<span class="section-tag">[Verse 1]</span>
Built this house from promises we made
Foundation cracked before the paint could fade
You said forever like it meant a thing
Now I'm just standing in the rain watching everything

We decorated rooms we'd never use
Filled the closets up with our excuse
That love was gonna be enough somehow
But look at where we're standing now

<span class="section-tag">[Chorus]</span>
We built our love on paper walls
One breath of truth and the whole thing falls
I should've known when the wind came through
That nothing built this fast could hold us two
Paper walls, paper hearts
Should've seen it from the start

<span class="section-tag">[Verse 2]</span>
Your toothbrush still sitting by the sink
Gives me way too much time to think
About the way you'd laugh at stupid things
Before the silence started settling in

I keep the curtains closed these days
Easier than facing empty space
But sunlight has a way of getting through
Just like the memories of you

<span class="section-tag">[Chorus]</span>
We built our love on paper walls
One breath of truth and the whole thing falls
I should've known when the wind came through
That nothing built this fast could hold us two
Paper walls, paper hearts
Should've seen it from the start

<span class="section-tag">[Bridge]</span>
Maybe next time I'll use stone
Maybe next time I won't feel so alone
But right now I'm just
Sweeping up the dust

<span class="section-tag">[Final Chorus]</span>
We built our love on paper walls
One breath of truth and the whole thing falls
I finally see what was always true
Some things aren't meant to make it through
Paper walls, paper hearts
This is where the healing starts
