<span class="section-tag">[Verse 1]</span>
Got a degree that's collecting dust
And a car that I barely trust
To get me to a job I hate
But at least it pays, so I guess that's great

My mom still asks about my plans
I just shrug and wash my hands
Of the expectations weighing down
Every conversation in this town

<span class="section-tag">[Chorus]</span>
I'm just a twenty-something figuring it out
Full of questions, full of doubt
They said by now I'd have it made
But I'm just trying to make the grade
A twenty-something mess, I confess
But maybe that's okay, I guess
We're all just faking it somehow
Learning how to live right now

<span class="section-tag">[Verse 2]</span>
My friends are getting married off
While I'm swiping right and coming up soft
Everyone's buying houses, having kids
I'm still wondering what my purpose is

Scrolling through their perfect lives
While I'm eating cereal at midnight, right
Comparison's a losing game
But I keep on playing it the same

<span class="section-tag">[Chorus]</span>
I'm just a twenty-something figuring it out
Full of questions, full of doubt
They said by now I'd have it made
But I'm just trying to make the grade
A twenty-something mess, I confess
But maybe that's okay, I guess
We're all just faking it somehow
Learning how to live right now

<span class="section-tag">[Bridge]</span>
Maybe the best years aren't behind
Maybe the good stuff's hard to find
Maybe growing up just means
Accepting life's not what it seems

<span class="section-tag">[Final Chorus]</span>
I'm just a twenty-something figuring it out
And that's what life is all about
No one really has it made
We're all just trying to make the grade
A twenty-something mess, I confess
And honestly, that's okay, I guess
We're all just faking it somehow
And that's enough for right now
