<span class="section-tag">[Verse 1]</span>
Can't find the frequency we used to share
I'm talking but you're never there
Just white noise filling up the space
Between your words and my misplaced

Hopes that we could find our way
Back to something real to say
But every time I try to tune you in
The signal breaks and we begin

<span class="section-tag">[Chorus]</span>
We're just static now
Lost the signal somehow
Used to come in crystal clear
Now I can barely hear
Your voice through all the noise
Just interference and broken joys
We're just static now
Don't know how to turn it around

<span class="section-tag">[Verse 2]</span>
Remember when we'd talk for hours
About nothing, but it felt like ours
A language only we could speak
Now I'm searching every week

For a sign that you're still there
Underneath the signal flare
But I'm getting tired of searching through
The static just to find you

<span class="section-tag">[Chorus]</span>
We're just static now
Lost the signal somehow
Used to come in crystal clear
Now I can barely hear
Your voice through all the noise
Just interference and broken joys
We're just static now
Don't know how to turn it around

<span class="section-tag">[Bridge]</span>
Maybe some connections fade
Maybe that's just how they're made
To burn bright and then burn out
Leave you wondering what it was about

<span class="section-tag">[Final Chorus]</span>
We were static at the end
Couldn't find our signal again
What came in so crystal clear
Faded out and disappeared
Your voice lost inside the noise
Just the echo of our joys
We were static at the end
And some signals never mend
