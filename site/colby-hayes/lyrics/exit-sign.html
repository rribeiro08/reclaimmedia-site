<span class="section-tag">[Verse 1]</span>
Red glow above the door you chose
The one that led you out of this
I watched you walk like it was easy
Like our years were just a myth

You packed your bags like packing lunch
Routine and cold and quick
And I just stood there like a statue
Watching our foundation slip

<span class="section-tag">[Chorus]</span>
You followed the exit sign
Like you'd been planning all this time
Left me standing in the hall
Wondering if you'd loved me at all
Every light that's pointing out
Reminds me what you're all about
You followed the exit sign
And left me here to walk the line

<span class="section-tag">[Verse 2]</span>
I used to think that running scared you
That you'd always find your way
Back to the place we built together
But you were leaving every day

Little pieces out the door
A book, a shirt, your favorite mug
I should've seen the signs you're giving
When you stopped giving me your love

<span class="section-tag">[Chorus]</span>
You followed the exit sign
Like you'd been planning all this time
Left me standing in the hall
Wondering if you'd loved me at all
Every light that's pointing out
Reminds me what you're all about
You followed the exit sign
And left me here to walk the line

<span class="section-tag">[Bridge]</span>
And maybe I should thank you
For showing me the truth
That I was loving someone
Who had one foot out the roof

<span class="section-tag">[Final Chorus]</span>
I'm taking down the exit signs
Rebuilding these walls that once were mine
Not standing in the hall no more
I'm finally walking through my door
Every light that's pointing in
Is where my next life begins
I'm covering the exit signs
This heart is no longer on the line
