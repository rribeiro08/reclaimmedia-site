<span class="section-tag">[Verse 1]</span>
Everyone's got their own way out
Some just leave without a doubt
But I've been standing at the door
For years now, maybe even more

It's not that I don't want to go
It's just the only life I know
And starting over sounds so brave
When you're not the one to wave

<span class="section-tag">[Chorus]</span>
I'm still learning how to leave
How to pack up what I believe
Was gonna last, was gonna stay
How to finally walk away
Learning how to close the door
On someone I still have love for
It's the hardest lesson yet
Learning how to just forget

<span class="section-tag">[Verse 2]</span>
My friends say I deserve much more
Than waiting by a closing door
And I know that they're probably right
But it's harder in the middle of the night

When the bed feels way too big
And I'm dancing to the same old gig
Of wondering what you're doing now
And if you ever think about how

<span class="section-tag">[Chorus]</span>
I'm still learning how to leave
How to pack up what I believe
Was gonna last, was gonna stay
How to finally walk away
Learning how to close the door
On someone I still have love for
It's the hardest lesson yet
Learning how to just forget

<span class="section-tag">[Bridge]</span>
But maybe leaving's not goodbye
Maybe it's just learning how to fly
On your own for the first time
Finding out that you'll be fine

<span class="section-tag">[Final Chorus]</span>
I finally learned how to leave
How to pack up what I believed
Was gonna last, was gonna stay
I'm finally walking away
I learned how to close the door
Still have love, but I want more
The hardest lesson I ever met
But I'm ready now to not forget
Just forgive, and start again
This is where my next life begins
