<span class="section-tag">[Verse 1]</span>
Drove past your mama's house today
Porch light on like it used to stay
When we'd sit out there past midnight
Talking dreams by the porch light

Main Street's got a coffee shop now
Where the old bookstore used to be somehow
Everything changes but stays the same
And this town still knows my name

<span class="section-tag">[Chorus]</span>
I'm just a hometown ghost
Haunting places I loved the most
Every corner's got a memory
Of who I was and who you were to me
A hometown ghost passing through
Every street's still haunted by you

<span class="section-tag">[Verse 2]</span>
The football field's got new lights now
Brighter than our Friday nights somehow
But I can still see us in the stands
Young and dumb, holding hands

People ask if I'm doing well
I smile and say I am, but who can tell
The difference between moving on
And just pretending that you're gone

<span class="section-tag">[Chorus]</span>
I'm just a hometown ghost
Haunting places I loved the most
Every corner's got a memory
Of who I was and who you were to me
A hometown ghost passing through
Every street's still haunted by you

<span class="section-tag">[Bridge]</span>
Maybe I should stop coming back
To a past I can't unpack
But there's something about where you're from
That keeps calling you home when you're done

<span class="section-tag">[Final Chorus]</span>
I'll always be a hometown ghost
Haunting places I loved the most
But maybe that's okay with me
To carry these memories quietly
A hometown ghost, I'll pass through
And make my peace with me and you
Some ghosts aren't meant to leave
They're just the price of what we believe
