<span class="section-tag">[Verse 1]</span>
We're not together but we're not apart
Living in the spaces between the heart
You text me back but you take your time
And I read into every single line

It's not a yes but it's not a no
You keep me close but you let me go
And I'm just floating in the in-between
The loneliest place I've ever been

<span class="section-tag">[Chorus]</span>
Somewhere between hello and goodbye
Between the truth and another white lie
You keep me hanging by a thread so thin
Somewhere between where we end and begin
I don't know how much longer I can stay
Somewhere between come closer and away

<span class="section-tag">[Verse 2]</span>
Your name lights up and my stomach drops
This rollercoaster never stops
One day you need me, next I don't exist
And I keep falling for the same old trick

My friends all say that I should walk away
But something keeps me choosing to stay
Maybe it's hope or maybe it's fear
Of finding out you were never here

<span class="section-tag">[Chorus]</span>
Somewhere between hello and goodbye
Between the truth and another white lie
You keep me hanging by a thread so thin
Somewhere between where we end and begin
I don't know how much longer I can stay
Somewhere between come closer and away

<span class="section-tag">[Bridge]</span>
I need an answer, any answer now
Even if it breaks me, show me how
This ends, because I can't keep living
In a love that takes more than it's giving

<span class="section-tag">[Final Chorus]</span>
I'm stepping out from between hello and goodbye
Done with the games and every white lie
I'm cutting loose from this thread so thin
Choosing myself is where I begin
I finally know I can't afford to stay
Somewhere between come closer and away
I'm walking out of the in-between
To the clearest place I've ever seen
