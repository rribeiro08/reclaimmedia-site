<span class="section-tag">[Verse 1]</span>
Thumb hovering over your name again
Three drinks deep and losing the game again
The bar's closing and I'm closing in
On the worst decision I could make tonight

Your contact photo's from last July
Back when I didn't have to wonder why
You'd pick up on the second ring
Now I don't know anything

<span class="section-tag">[Chorus]</span>
I almost called you at 2AM
Almost let myself fall again
Into the comfort of your voice
Like I ever had a choice
I almost called, almost gave in
Almost let you back under my skin
But I put the phone down instead
And called a cab home to my bed

<span class="section-tag">[Verse 2]</span>
My friends don't know I still do this
Keep your number like a secret wish
Tucked away for emergencies
But every lonely night's a crisis, please

I wrote a text, deleted it twice
Typed "I miss you," thought that wasn't nice
To either one of us right now
We're better off apart somehow

<span class="section-tag">[Chorus]</span>
I almost called you at 2AM
Almost let myself fall again
Into the comfort of your voice
Like I ever had a choice
I almost called, almost gave in
Almost let you back under my skin
But I put the phone down instead
And called a cab home to my bed

<span class="section-tag">[Bridge]</span>
One day I'll delete your number
One day I'll wake from this slumber
But tonight I'll take the win
Of almost calling but not giving in

<span class="section-tag">[Final Chorus]</span>
I almost called you at 2AM
But I didn't and that's where I am
Stronger than I was before
One almost closer to the door
I almost called, but I held on
To the reason that I have to move on
Put the phone down, went to bed
Chose myself for once instead
