<span class="section-tag">[Verse 1]</span>
We were so close, knew every line
On each other's faces, every sign
Now we pass like we never met
Like our history's something to forget

You nod politely, I do the same
Playing this ridiculous game
Of pretending that we don't know
Every secret from long ago

<span class="section-tag">[Chorus]</span>
We make better strangers now
Than we ever made as lovers somehow
At least the silence doesn't sting
When you don't owe each other anything
We make better strangers, it's true
Easier than being me and you

<span class="section-tag">[Verse 2]</span>
Saw you laughing with someone new
Doing all the things we used to do
And I wanted it to hurt but instead
I just felt something quiet and dead

Maybe that's the saddest part
Not the breaking of a heart
But the moment when you realize
You're looking at them with stranger's eyes

<span class="section-tag">[Chorus]</span>
We make better strangers now
Than we ever made as lovers somehow
At least the silence doesn't sting
When you don't owe each other anything
We make better strangers, it's true
Easier than being me and you

<span class="section-tag">[Bridge]</span>
Maybe love was just a season
We outgrew without a reason
Some people are just passing through
I guess that's me, I guess that's you

<span class="section-tag">[Final Chorus]</span>
We make better strangers now
And I've made my peace with that somehow
The silence doesn't even sting
When you don't owe each other anything
We make better strangers, it's true
And I'm finally okay with that view
Better strangers than bitter friends
This is how our story ends
